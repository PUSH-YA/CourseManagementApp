# An Assignment Scheduler

## automatically schedules your assignments helping you decrease your procrastination

**Application functionality: **
You add *Assignments* into a checklist of sort with date and the estimate time needed to complete the application.
The application will shedule the tasks based on the date and the estimate time needed automatically and then show the
schedule that it created for you. This will help you focus on just doing the tasks rather than organising. Once the task
is finished, simply click *"done"* on the checklist and it will remove the task from the schedule visualisation.

**Users for the application:**
It is made for people who need help with procrastination and who need help with organising their tasks.
This will be especially useful for children studying in *schools* or *universities* but can be used by *anyone who does not
have enough time on their hands to meticulously make a schedule and organise* for all the work piling up for them.

**Personal interest?**
I have always been interested in preparing an optimum schedule for myself which helps me relax myself. While taking
summer courses right after a short vacation, I realised how easy it is for the pressure of work to make you unproductive.
In such cases, I think having an organised schedule can ease the pressure of getting the tasks done and thus, I think that
having a user friendly interface that automatically schedules tasks for you can be really helpful for everyone.

**User story for my application: **
- As a user, I want to add my upcoming assignment with dates and estimated time needed
- As a user, I want to schedule my upcoming tasks automatically
- As a user, I want to see my schedule for the tasks
- As a user, I want to complete the task and remove the tasks from the checklist
- As a user, I want to see the scheduling be updated in real time with the checklist
