# An Course management planner

## Helps you manage the workload for your courses

**Application functionality:**
You add *Courses* into the application and then you can add the workload for the courses such as the assignments or
homework. For each workload, it will ask you to add date, time and the estimated time taken for to finish the task. The
application will then create an automatic schedule for you and remind you the tasks due for the day. After you finish the
tasks, you will be able to the marks you received and the weighing percentage of those marks. This will help you keep up
with your marks for the courses and your current progress, both of these combined should decrease your procrastination.
All of the scheduling and progress can also be seen visually with a proper schedule for the day or the week [TBD: depending
on which looks better].

**Users for the application:**
It is made for people who need help with procrastination and who need help with organising their tasks.
This will be especially useful for children studying in *schools* or *universities* but can be used by *anyone who does not
have enough time on their hands to meticulously make a schedule and organise* for all the work piling up for them.

**Personal interest?**
I have always been interested in preparing an optimum schedule for myself which helps me relax myself. While taking
summer courses right after a short vacation, I realised how easy it is for the pressure of work to make you unproductive.
In such cases, I think having an organised schedule and a management system can ease the pressure of getting the tasks done
and thus, I think that having a user friendly interface that automatically schedules tasks for you can be really helpful
for everyone.

**User story for my application:**
- As a user, I want to add add my courses to the system
- As a user, I want to keep all the workload for my courses on the same system
- As a user, I want to add my assignments to do for the courses in the management system
- As a user, I want to schedule my upcoming tasks automatically [Optional, not sure yet]
- As a user, I want to be reminded of the tasks to do based on the schedule made
- As a user, I want to visualise the schedule made
- As a user, I want to keep track of the grades of the received and how I am doing in the course
