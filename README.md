# A Course management System

## Helps you manage the workload for your courses

**Application functionality:**
You add *Courses* to the application and then you can add the workload for the courses such as the assignments or
homework. For each workload, it will ask you to add date, time and the estimated time taken for you to finish the task. The
application will then create an automatic schedule for you and remind you the tasks due for the day [when opened]. After
you finish the tasks, you will be able to add the marks you received and the weighing percentage of those marks. This will
help you keep up with your marks for the courses and your current progress, both of these combined should decrease your
procrastination. All of the scheduling and progress can also be seen visually with a proper schedule for the day or the
week [TBD: depending on which is more aesthetically pleasing visually].

**Users for the application:**
It is made for people who need help with procrastination and who need help with organising their tasks.
This will be especially useful for children studying in *schools* or *universities* but can be used by *anyone who does not
have enough time on their hands to meticulously make a schedule and organise* for all the work piling up for them.

**Personal interest?**
I have always been interested in preparing an optimum schedule for myself which helps me relax. While taking
summer courses right after a short vacation, I realised how easy it is for pressure to make you less organised which makes
you less productive/procrastinate and the cycle begins again. In such cases, I think having an management system where you
can schedule your courses' work and keep up with progress you are making in the course can ease the pressure of getting
the tasks done. Also, I think that having a user friendly interface that automatically schedules tasks for you can be
really helpful for almost everyone.

**User story for my application:**
- As a user, I want to add add my courses to the system
- As a user, I want to keep all the workload [assignments and homework] for those courses on the system
- As a user, I want to schedule my upcoming tasks automatically based on the workload [Optional, not sure yet]
- As a user, I want to visualise the schedule made
- As a user, I want to be reminded of the tasks to do based on the schedule made
- As a user, I want to keep track of the grades of the received and how I am doing in the course
